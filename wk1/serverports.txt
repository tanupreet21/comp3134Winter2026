1. Definition of Server Port:
A server port is a logical communication endpoint on a computer or server that allows applications to send and receive data over the internet or a network. Each port has a unique number that identifies a specific service or application (like HTTP, FTP, or SSH).

2. Server Port Range:
Server ports are numbered from 0 to 65535. They are categorized as follows:
- 0 – 1023: Well-known ports (reserved for standard services)
- 1024 – 49151: Registered ports (used by user-installed applications)
- 49152 – 65535: Dynamic/private ports (used temporarily by applications)

3. Number of Bits for Port Number:
Since the maximum port number is 65535, port numbers are represented using 16 bits.
